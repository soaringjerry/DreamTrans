# Smart Streaming Text Update

## Overview

Implemented an intelligent streaming text display that mimics human typing behavior, including the ability to delete and retype when text changes.

## Key Features

### 1. **Smart Text Diffing**
- Finds the common prefix between old and new text
- Only deletes characters that have changed
- Preserves unchanged prefix to minimize visual disruption

### 2. **Natural Deletion Animation**
- When text changes, characters are deleted one by one from the end
- Deletion is faster than typing (5ms vs 20ms per character)
- Red cursor during deletion for visual feedback

### 3. **Immediate Final Text Display**
- When receiving final transcript, text is displayed immediately
- No animation for confirmed text - ensures accuracy
- Partial text continues to use streaming effect

### 4. **Visual Feedback**
- Amber cursor when typing
- Red cursor when deleting
- Faster blink rate during deletion
- Smooth transitions between states
